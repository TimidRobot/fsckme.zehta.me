## Overview

Each of the graphs below was created by simulating 100,000 dice rolls per
Ability Score (500,000 rolls per graph and 1,500,000 total rolls). The work was
inspired by [A Treatise on Different Dice-rolling Mechanics in RPGs][treatise].
The graphs were created using [TimZehta/rpgdice Â· GitHub][github].
