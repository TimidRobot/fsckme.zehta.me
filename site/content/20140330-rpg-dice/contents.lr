### Overview

[github]: https://github.com/TimZehta/rpgdice

I wrote a Python program that simulates different RPG dice mechanics (rulesets)
and creates graphs showing the probability of the different outcomes:

### matplotlib install

matplotlib is super painful to install on macOS Mavericks 10.9.2. I ended up
creating an installation script ([`install_requirements.sh`][install]) to help
with debugging the mess and allowing me to reliably reproduce success.

### ggplot

This project was the first time I've worked with [ggplot][ggplot]. I'm very
glad for the shortcuts it provided. I would love to see it become more well
known and successful.
