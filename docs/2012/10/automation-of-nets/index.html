  <p>For me, at least, systems administration is a difficult field to define and
talk about--especially succinctly. A couple of excellent blog posts suggest the
following definition for Systems Administration: <strong>the automation of networks
of networks.</strong></p>
<p>Automation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore, SREs spend half their time writing code to eliminate what they do
the other half of their day. When they "automate themselves out of a job" it
is cause for celebration and they get to pick a new project. There are
always more projects.</p>

years?</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Networks of Networks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Findings so far suggest that networks of networks pose risks of catastrophic
danger that can exceed the risks in isolated systems. A seemingly benign
disruption can generate rippling negative effects. Those effects can cost
millions of dollars, or even billions, when stock markets crash, half of
India loses power or an Icelandic volcano spews ash into the sky, shutting
down air travel and overwhelming hotels and rental car companies. In other
cases, failure within a network of networks can mean the difference between
a minor disease outbreak or a pandemic, a foiled terrorist attack or one
that kills thousands of people.</p>

<p>The concept of networks of networks also servers to differentiate system administrators from programmers (not 100% accurate, but helpful none-the-less).</p>
