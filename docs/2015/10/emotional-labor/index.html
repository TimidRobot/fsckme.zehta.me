  <p>I recently read an amazing document. It was a digest of a message thread about
Emotional Labor. Before I was done I knew I wanted to share it with everyone I
cared about. To that end I collaborated with the creator of the digest to
update the formatting of the document. I hope the result is very easy and
comfortable (formatting-wise) to read. Please check it out: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0UUYL6kaNeBTDBRbkJkeUtabEk/view?usp=sharing">Emotional Labor:
The MetaFilter Thread Condensed (PDF)</a>.</p>
