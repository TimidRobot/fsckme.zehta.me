  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I wrote a Python program that allows the generation of <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a>
Monster Cards. They can be made from the source files containing the Dungeon
World monsters or from custom YAML files.</p>
<p>I am pleased with the outcome. The formatting does not match the Dungeon World
text, but the most significant changes are intentional. I think they make the
cards easier to use. I especially like the way I categorized and ordered the
tags.</p>
<h2>ReportLab</h2>
<p>This project was the first time that I've worked with the
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab/">ReportLab</a> Python module. It was very refreshing to do non-WYSIWYG
layout.  Overall my experience was very positive.</p>

  <p>One of my own troubleshooting or programming rules is to go to bed. Over and
over again, I have discovered that I will fail to solve a problem if I focus
too stubbornly on it. If I go to bed, however, the answer is usually waiting
for me as soon as I wake up or pick up the problem again.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this while reading the highly fascinating article, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/07/130107fa_fact_green">Adam
Green: The Spectacular Thefts of Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a> (linked
from <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/apollo_robbins.html">Schneier on Security: Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>"inattentional blindness," the phenomenon of focussing so intently on a
single task that one fails to notice things in plain sight.</p>

  <p>We recently observed constant write activity on our development server, while
watching dstat. With the help of <a href="http://guichaz.free.fr/iotop/"><code>iotop</code></a>, we identified the Apache web
server was the culprit. But why would apache be doing so many writes? That's
not normal behavior (excluding the the logs). We then used auditd to log
writes by apache.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">sudo auditctl -a exit,always -S write -F uid=33
</code></pre>
<p>We also logged opens that were not O_RDONLY:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">sudo auditctl -a exit,always -S open -F uid=33 -F a1&#39;!=0&#39;`
</code></pre>
<p>This resulted in the following rules:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">sudo auditctl -l LIST_RULES: exit,always uid=33 (0x21) syscall=write LIST_RULES: exit,always uid=33 (0x21) a1!=0 syscall=open
</code></pre>
<p>This allowed us to isolate a PHP module that was completely broken (using
<code>aureport</code>).</p>
