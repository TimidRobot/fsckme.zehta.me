  <p>One of my own troubleshooting or programming rules is to go to bed. Over and
over again, I have discovered that I will fail to solve a problem if I focus
too stubbornly on it. If I go to bed, however, the answer is usually waiting
for me as soon as I wake up or pick up the problem again.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this while reading the highly fascinating article, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/07/130107fa_fact_green">Adam
Green: The Spectacular Thefts of Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a> (linked
from <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/apollo_robbins.html">Schneier on Security: Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>"inattentional blindness," the phenomenon of focussing so intently on a
single task that one fails to notice things in plain sight.</p>

  <p>We recently observed constant write activity on our development server, while
watching dstat. With the help of <a href="http://guichaz.free.fr/iotop/"><code>iotop</code></a>, we identified the Apache web
server was the culprit. But why would apache be doing so many writes? That's
not normal behavior (excluding the the logs). We then used auditd to log
writes by apache.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">sudo auditctl -a exit,always -S write -F uid=33
</code></pre>
<p>We also logged opens that were not O_RDONLY:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">sudo auditctl -a exit,always -S open -F uid=33 -F a1&#39;!=0&#39;`
</code></pre>
<p>This resulted in the following rules:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">sudo auditctl -l LIST_RULES: exit,always uid=33 (0x21) syscall=write LIST_RULES: exit,always uid=33 (0x21) a1!=0 syscall=open
</code></pre>
<p>This allowed us to isolate a PHP module that was completely broken (using
<code>aureport</code>).</p>

  <p>For me, at least, systems administration is a difficult field to define and
talk about--especially succinctly. A couple of excellent blog posts suggest the
following definition for Systems Administration: <strong>the automation of networks
of networks.</strong></p>
<p>Automation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore, SREs spend half their time writing code to eliminate what they do
the other half of their day. When they "automate themselves out of a job" it
is cause for celebration and they get to pick a new project. There are
always more projects.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/10/whatschangedsre.html">Everything Sysadmin: Has the job of a Google SRE changed over the
years?</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Networks of Networks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Findings so far suggest that networks of networks pose risks of catastrophic
danger that can exceed the risks in isolated systems. A seemingly benign
disruption can generate rippling negative effects. Those effects can cost
millions of dollars, or even billions, when stock markets crash, half of
India loses power or an Icelandic volcano spews ash into the sky, shutting
down air travel and overwhelming hotels and rental car companies. In other
cases, failure within a network of networks can mean the difference between
a minor disease outbreak or a pandemic, a foiled terrorist attack or one
that kills thousands of people.</p>

The Insecurity of Networks</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of networks of networks also servers to differentiate system administrators from programmers (not 100% accurate, but helpful none-the-less).</p>
