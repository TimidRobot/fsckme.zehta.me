<p><strong>Tim Wheeler. Name Tags. 1999 Aug - 2002 Feb</strong>
<br><strong>2 Purchased Plastic Name Tags</strong></p>
<p>These name tags are the objects of a performance piece performed daily over two
and half years. They not only served as the focal point or medium for
conversations, but often modified or dictated how people interacted with me.
They made, me at once, distinct and invisible. They placed me on a specific
socio-economic plane. They positioned me within the spectrum of service
industry jobs. They were a symbols for which the most common meaning seemed to
be "approachable."</p>
<p>The habitual (obsessive?) wearing of the name tags also became the symbols with
which others mapped my identity. The extent to which people not only defined
me, but drew some sort of stability from the ritual, was evident on the
occasions when I happened or appeared not to be wearing them.</p>
<p>I donated the name tags to the Student for Student Scholarship Fund (SSSF).
They were sold in the SSSF auction, 2009 Feb 22, for $30. I no longer wear name
tags for any extend amount of time.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see the extent to which people associated the name tags
with me--the extent to which they formed my identity as it was perceived by
others. There were times when I wasn’t wearing them that people would talk and
point as if I had one on. It took months for people I saw every week (or more)
to realize that I was no longer wearing them.</p>

  </p><pre><code>As I watched, the upright bassists hands,
Became spiders jumping on silken strands.
The bassist told a primitive tale
That was interrupted by the trumpets wail.
The trumpet argued the complexity
The sax agreed with Melody.
The drums enforced the upright bass.
Rhythms feet stomped a monstrous pace.
    That sent up clouds of dust.
        The pianist swayed with lust
        For the moves of Melody.

Hand in Hand, Rhythm and Melody,
Danced a dance to set us free
To set sparks in the musicians eyes
That reinforced the saxs cries
That gave force to the drummers beat
And set springs beneath our pounding feet.

A solo sprawled on the throat of the sax
It loosened our bodies and let our eyes relax
The guitarist told stories with his hands
Of distant places and caravans
The trumpet let out a powerful plea
Causing us to nod and agree.
A concentrated look on his face,
Hammering his notes into place,
    The pianist made a floor
On which Rhythm and Melody danced some more.
They danced above the ground
As the upright bass lent a solid sound
And when the drum found his voice
We were left without choice
But to sway and stomp some more.
So we happily stomped and swayed.
We danced as the jazz band played!
