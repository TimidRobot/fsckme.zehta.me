  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I wrote a Python program that simulates different RPG dice mechanics (rulesets)
and creates graphs showing the probability of the different outcomes:

<h2>matplotlib install</h2>
<p>matplotlib is super painful to install on OS X Mavericks 10.9.2. I ended up
creating an installation script (<a href="https://github.com/TimZehta/rpgdice/blob/master/install_requirements.sh"><code>install_requirements.sh</code></a>) to help
with debugging the mess and allowing me to reliably reproduce success.</p>
<h2>ggplot</h2>
<p>This project was the first time I've worked with <a href="https://github.com/yhat/ggplot/">ggplot</a>. I'm very
glad for the shortcuts it provided. I would love to see it become more well
known and successful.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I wrote a Python program that allows the generation of <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a>
Monster Cards. They can be made from the source files containing the Dungeon
World monsters or from custom YAML files.</p>
<p>I am pleased with the outcome. The formatting does not match the Dungeon World
text, but the most significant changes are intentional. I think they make the
cards easier to use. I especially like the way I categorized and ordered the
tags.</p>
<h2>ReportLab</h2>
<p>This project was the first time that I've worked with the
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab/">ReportLab</a> Python module. It was very refreshing to do non-WYSIWYG
layout.  Overall my experience was very positive.</p>

  <p>One of my own troubleshooting or programming rules is to go to bed. Over and
over again, I have discovered that I will fail to solve a problem if I focus
too stubbornly on it. If I go to bed, however, the answer is usually waiting
for me as soon as I wake up or pick up the problem again.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this while reading the highly fascinating article, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/07/130107fa_fact_green">Adam
Green: The Spectacular Thefts of Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a> (linked
from <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/apollo_robbins.html">Schneier on Security: Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>"inattentional blindness," the phenomenon of focussing so intently on a
single task that one fails to notice things in plain sight.</p>
