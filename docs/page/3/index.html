  </p><p>One of my own troubleshooting or programming rules is to go to bed. Over and
over again, I have discovered that I will fail to solve a problem if I focus
too stubbornly on it. If I go to bed, however, the answer is usually waiting
for me as soon as I wake up or pick up the problem again.

  </p><p>We recently observed constant write activity on our development server, while
watching dstat. With the help of <code>iotop</code> (<a href="http://guichaz.free.fr/iotop/">iotop</a>), we identified the
Apache web server was the culprit.

  </p><p>For me, at least, systems administration is a difficult field to define and
talk about--especially succinctly. A couple of excellent blog posts suggest the
following definition for Systems Administration: <strong>the automation of networks

  </p><p>On Friday 2012-09-28, my MacBook Pro started freezing. There had been no
significant software updates that morning (though 10.8.2 came out that week).</p>
<p>I didn't want to deal with it, so I took it to the Apple Store. Unfortunately,
they simply wasted a few days (given the solution found, I'm confident they
never let it run more than an hour).

systems that benefit from that granularity of tuning.</p>
