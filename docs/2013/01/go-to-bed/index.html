  <p>One of my own troubleshooting or programming rules is to go to bed. Over and
over again, I have discovered that I will fail to solve a problem if I focus
too stubbornly on it. If I go to bed, however, the answer is usually waiting
for me as soon as I wake up or pick up the problem again.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this while reading the highly fascinating article, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/07/130107fa_fact_green">Adam
Green: The Spectacular Thefts of Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a> (linked
from <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/apollo_robbins.html">Schneier on Security: Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>"inattentional blindness," the phenomenon of focussing so intently on a
single task that one fails to notice things in plain sight.</p>
