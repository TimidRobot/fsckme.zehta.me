  <h2>Open Development with SaltStack</h2>
  <p class="meta">
    2019-04-17, Wednesday, Timid Robot Zehta
  </p>
  <p>I am excited to publicize the open source repository for our SaltStack
configuration: <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/sre-salt-prime">creativecommons/sre-salt-prime</a>. This is a
rare offering. Not many configuration management system repositories are open
sourced. Read on for why this is important to me :)</p>
<p>I really like open source software (<a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">The Open Source Definition (Annotated) |
Open Source Initiative</a>). Over the years it has provided me with access
and capabilities I would not normally be able to afford.</p>
<p>I had very little money in college. My first computer was salvaged from a
dumpster and ran entirely on open source software. I was once reduced to
begging a few dollars to satisfy a museum's arbitrarily enforced "suggested
donation". Thankfully, open source image manipulation software powered many of
my art projects.</p>
<p>With the exception of typing class in high school and a few training sessions
at work, I have never received any formal computer training. Instead, I was
able to teach myself by using and investigating open source software. I have
been able to determine exactly why open source software behaves the way it does
by looking at the source code. It is instructive to be able to synthesize
complex systems as a single user and participate in the same communities as
SysAdmins using the same software with thousands or millions of users.</p>
<p>I've been gainfully employed in the technology sector for over a decade so the
free cost of open source software is not as necessary to me. However, open
source software remains very important. As a SysAdmin, I have repeatedly found
open source communities to be a better resource for support than even the most
expensive maintenance contract. The ability to make at-will modifications to a
codebase can save project timelines, and seeing those modifications accepted
upstream is deeply satisfying.</p>
<p>When I started at Creative Commons in the fall of 2018, I began using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(software)">SaltStack</a> full time. As part of my work on developing
infrastructure as code at Creative Commons, I created a new open source
repository for our SaltStack configuration:
<a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/sre-salt-prime">creativecommons/sre-salt-prime</a>. While working on
provisioning of AWS resources, I have had trouble finding examples. I learn
best by example and I know I’m not alone. I hope opening this repository helps
other Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and Systems Administrators (SysAdmins).</p>
<p>I expect that working in the open will improve the quality of my work. Research
has not only shown that people produce higher quality work when they expect it
to be reviewed or shared, but also that open source allows others to provide
criticism, feedback, and contributions.</p>
<p>Perhaps most of all, I hope to give back to the community. I hope it helps
others learn when they do not have access to proprietary software at home,
school, or work. I hope that my work in the open might lower the resources
required to implement open source for others.</p>
