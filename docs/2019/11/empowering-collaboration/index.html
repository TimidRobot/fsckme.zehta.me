  <h2>Empowering Collaboration in the Common</h2>
  <p class="meta">
    2019-11-25, Monday, Timid Robot Zehta
  </p>
  <p>In the past few months I have been privileged to attend <a href="https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2019:Program">Wikimania
2019</a> and the Google Summer of Code <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gsoc-mentorsummit2019/home">2019 Mentor
Summit</a>. At these events I was overwhelmed with the amount of
care and effort people are putting into their projects and communities.</p>
<p>At Wikimania 2019, I was impressed with how much overlap there is between the
Creative Commons and Wikimedia communities. Both communities are actively
engaged in expanding the content and participation in the commons--in the
collection and communities empowered by open content. I have a lot of hope in
what existing and future collaborations will allow. At the conference, I got to
see just the tip of the iceberg representing volunteers’ work across the globe.
I hope we at Creative Commons can continue to keep the demands of our daily
workloads in perspective and increase collaboration with the global effort.</p>
<p>At the GSoC 2019 Mentor Summit I was able to attend a good number of sessions
on increasing and maintaining participation. Based on the session discussions
and the work already being done by other organizations, I expect we’ll pursue
the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved support for first timers--people who are engaging with code
repositories for the first time<ul>
<li>Improve tagging of issues</li>
<li>Dedicated documentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve support for GSoC and Outreachy program applicants<ul>
<li>Provide application templates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Participate in social media networks to actively recruit groups who are
underrepresented in FOSS (free and open source software)</li>
<li>Collect anonymous demographic data </li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of organization examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Lab: <a href="https://code.publiclab.org/">Community toolbox</a></li>
<li>Python Software Foundation: <a href="https://python-gsoc.org/index.html">Python GSoC – Home</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to the community and the work you're doing &lt;3</p>
