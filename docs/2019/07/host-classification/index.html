  <h2>Host Classification with SaltStack</h2>
  <p class="meta">

  </p>
  <p>Within infrastructure as code, as with all programming, there is a goal to
reduce redundancy as much as possible. With configuration management,
duplicated configurations can quickly lead to confusion and unexpected states.
One of the key ways to reduce configuration duplication is robust host
classification.</p>
<h3 id="minion-classification">Minion Classification</h3><p>As this post is about SaltStack, the terms "minion classification" for "host
classification" and "minion" for "host" are used. With Puppet, "node
classification" and "node" would be used.</p>
<p>Minion classification consists of rules that determine what a minion is and
which states (or configurations) should be applied to it. Good minion
classification removes or minimizes the necessity of explicitly assigning
configurations to a minion. Our goal is for the computer to do as much of the
work as possible.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3><p>Minions are added and configured from the primary salt server (called the
salt-master) with the following Minion ID schema: <strong><code>HST__POD__LOC</code></strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>HST</code></strong> is the hostname or role. It indications what services are running
on the host or the role that it serves.</li>
<li><strong><code>POD</code></strong> is the pod or group. It indicates the logical grouping of the
host.</li>
<li><strong><code>LOC</code></strong> is the location. It indicates where the host is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wordpress__prod__us-east-2</code></li>
<li><code>wordpress__stage__us-east-2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The Minion ID parts are matched against the following list. SaltStack pillar
data, like Apache2, uses a last declared wins model. The following list is
organized from least-specific to most-specific:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>1_LOC</code> (location)</li>
<li><code>2_POD</code> (pod/group)</li>
<li><code>3_HST</code> (host/role)</li>
<li><code>4_POD__LOC</code> (pod/group and location)</li>
<li><code>5_HST__POD</code> (host/role and pod/group)</li>
</ol>
<p>Using our Minion ID examples above, this allows configuration data to be
specified for both shared data (ex. WordPress security settings that should be
applied to all WordPress hosts/roles) and specific data (ex. Let's Encrypt
TLS/SSL settings).</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2><p><em>The only grain which can be safely used is <code>grains['id']</code> which contains the
Minion ID.</em> (<a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/faq.html#is-targeting-using-grain-data-secure">FAQ Q.21</a>)</p>
<p>It is important to rely <em>only</em> on the Minion ID as all other grains can be
manipulated by the client. This means a compromised client could change its
grains to collect secrets if a dedicated grain (ex. <code>role</code>) was used for minion
classification.</p>
<h3 id="imperfect-work-in-progress">Imperfect Work in Progress</h3><p>This implementation has proven to be robust and helpful. However, there is
still room for improvement. For example, I will probably refactor <code>HST</code> to
<code>ROLE</code> and <code>POD</code> to <code>GRP</code> for added clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback and development is welcomed.</strong></p>
