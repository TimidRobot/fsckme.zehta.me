### Overview

[treatise]: http://rpg-design.wikidot.com/evaluation
[github]: https://github.com/TimZehta/rpgdice

Each of the graphs below was created by simulating 100,000 dice rolls for each
die in each graph (400,000 to 900,000 rolls per graph and 6,000,000 total
rolls). The work was inspired by [A Treatise on Different Dice-rolling
Mechanics in RPGs][treatise].  The graphs were created using [TimZehta/rpgdice
Â· GitHub][github].

### Graphs

The 2nd line of the title is an attempt to describe the dice simulated. They
are shown in the top left corner of the graph.

While Despair and Triumph do not cancel each other out, Despair is graphed to
the left of zero to maintain its sinister meaning.

Probabilties below 0.5% were discarded.
