I really wanted to use SaltStack to configure my home Linux router. It would be
wonderful to manage that infrastructure as code. Unfortunately, it does not
seem tenable for me.

## Issues at Home


### Does not support Python 3.8+ on macOS

My goal was to be able to push configurations using `salt-ssh` from my macOS
laptop. SaltStack claims macOS is supported. [Salt Project][saltproject]
(emphasis added):
> Salt is tested and packaged to run on CentOS, Debian, RHEL, Ubuntu,
> **MacOS**, Windows, and more.

I originally installed SaltStack via homebrew, but had to switch to a Python
3.7 virtual environment due to:
- ~~`2020 Jun 21`: [[BUG] AttributeError: 'Process' object has no attribute
  '_args_for_getstate' · Issue #57742 · saltstack/salt][i57742]~~
<!-- x_ fix vim markdown highlight issue -->
- ~~`2022 Jan 09`: [[BUG] salt-ssh fails due to attempting to pickle
  _thread._local object · Issue #61435 · saltstack/salt][i61435]~~
<!-- x_ fix vim markdown highlight issue -->

**Update:** These problems existed between the release of Python 3.8 on
`2019 Oct 14` and the release of Salt version `3005` on `2022-08-25`.

### Cannot use gitfs with salt-ssh

With SaltStack appearing to work, I wanted to use SaltStack Formulas.
Unfortunately, that option has been unsupported since 2005:
- ~~`2015 May 12`: [Cannot use gitfs with salt-ssh · Issue #23576 ·
  saltstack/salt][i23576]~~

I also tried to symlink git submodules in, but I encountered the same error.

**Update:** Maybe I misidentified the problem. The issue above was closed on
`2022 Mar 14` with a comment indicating there are other issues.

### Docker images unmaintained

I thought I might have fewer issues if I might moved my use case closer to the
SaltStack mainstream by using a SaltStack docker image. ~~Unfortunately, no
`3004` docker image was available~~ (note update, below). [saltstack/salt -
Docker Image | Docker Hub][dockersalt]:
> **Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links**
>
> - `3004rc1`, `rc`
> - `3003.3`, `3003.2`, `3003.1`, `3003`, `latest`

[dockersalt]: https://hub.docker.com/r/saltstack/salt

I realize I could create my own docker image, but I encountered this when my
capacity for workarounds was already at its limit.

**Update:** At some point after `2022 May 03`, the docker image creation
pipeline was fixed. The `3004` image was last pushed on `2022 Oct 04` (just over
2 years after the release of SaltStack `3004` on `2021 Oct 18`).


## Issues at Work


### Lack of Open Community

In learning and using SaltStack, I've frequently come up against a terrible
lack of examples and documentation of SaltStack in use. It seems to be getting
worse as the few examples I did find are becoming outdated.

At work, I've tried to use SaltStack in the open so others can build on my
work. I've blogged about it previously ([SaltStack tag - Timid
Robot](/tags/saltstack/)). So far, engagement has been nonexistent.

I spent years working with Puppet, which had a much stronger community.


### Incomplete Migration from Python 2.7 to Python 3

I use `boto_rds` for provisioning:
- `2022 Jan 31`: [[BUG] boto_rds.subnet_group_present broken · Issue #61555 ·
  saltstack/salt][i61555]

**Update:** This issue remains open as of `2023 Feb 01`.

[i61555]: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61555


### More `salt-ssh` Trouble

I use `salt-ssh` for the initial setup of newly provisioned EC2 instances:
- `2022 Jan 27`: [[BUG] salt-ssh requires the distro python package · Issue
  #61535 · saltstack/salt][i61535]

**Update:** This issue remains open as of `2023 Feb 01`.

### Overwhelming Backlog

The backlog contains many ancient and higher severity issues that deal with the
functionality I am interested in (ex. `salt-ssh`):

## Conclusion

I really wanted to love SaltStack. I love Python. I love a lot of the design
decisions made by SaltStack. It seems like the core use case (avoiding
`salt-ssh`, orchestration, and provisioning) is viable. SaltStack might work
very very well for you. I respect the developers (especially the volunteer
developers) who are working on a great product. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel
like SaltStack will work well for me.

I expect that next I'll try Ansible at home:

## Ansible Success

`2022 May 03`: Not long after writing this post, my firewall's RAM was damaged
by a blackout and I had to rebuild it. I was able to do fairly quickly, even
though I was learning Ansible at the same time. So far, I've really enjoyed
Ansible. My only complaint is that it is slow (though fast enough for my
needs).


## Updates

  - Added update notes throughout
  - Made date formats consistent
- `2022 May 03`:
  - Added recheck date to Docker images unmaintained section
