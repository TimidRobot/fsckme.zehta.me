Back in 2015, I read an amazing document. It was a digest of a message thread
about Emotional Labor. Before I was done I knew I wanted to share it with
everyone I cared about.

<!-- PLUGIN-READ-FULL-POST -->

To that end I collaborated with the creator of the digest to
update the formatting of the document. I hope the result is very easy and
comfortable (formatting-wise) to read. Please check it out: **[Emotional Labor:
The MetaFilter Thread Condensed (PDF)][pdf]**.

It's been top of mind lately. Since a Google security change broke the original
link, I've been replying almost every day to someone asking for access.

## Feedback Over the Years

Since my email address is in the document, I've been fortunate enough to
receive feedback over the years. Most of it simply expresses gratitude. Here
are some anonymized excerpts about the content itself:

  > I'm a relationship counselor. A common relationship issue (as you might
  > expect) is emotional labor, and people often don't have language for what
