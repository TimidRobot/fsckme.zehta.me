Back in 2015, I read an amazing document. It was a digest of a message thread
about Emotional Labor. Before I was done I knew I wanted to share it with
everyone I cared about.

<!-- PLUGIN-READ-FULL-POST -->

To that end I collaborated with the creator of the digest to
update the formatting of the document. I hope the result is very easy and
comfortable (formatting-wise) to read. Please check it out: **[Emotional Labor:
The MetaFilter Thread Condensed (PDF)][pdf]**.

It's been top of mind lately. Since a Google security change broke the original
link, I've been replying almost every day to someone asking for access.
